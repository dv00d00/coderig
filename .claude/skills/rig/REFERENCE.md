# rig — reference

## Command reference

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `rig index <sln\|csproj> [--rules p…] [--identity id] [--from entry.csproj] [--framework tfm] [--parallelism n] [--merge] [--include-tests] [--no-graph]` | Extract facts. Solution = all projects' source in one run (callgraph crosses boundaries in-process). Single `.csproj` = that project's source only (refs become metadata DLLs). **`--from entry.csproj`** = index only the entry project's transitive ProjectReference closure (minus test projects) — still ONE cross-project workspace; writes the closure to `relevant-projects.json`. **`--framework tfm`** selects that TFM for multi-targeted projects; without it the first declared TFM is used. **`--parallelism n`** parallelises the (independent, no-binary) design-time builds. **Save is fast + crash-safe by default**: durability-off pragmas + write-to-temp + atomic rename over `rig.db` (so a fresh `index` cleanly REPLACES — the old "index APPENDS" footgun is gone; that now only applies to `--identity`). **`--include-tests`** keeps test projects (excluded by default); **`--no-build-cache`** / **`--verify-build-cache`** control the design-time-build cache. (There is NO `--durable`/journaled-write option — removed.) |
| `rig runs` | List runs + symbol/reference/di counts (provenance / health check). |
| `rig derive [--rules p…] [--limit n] [--only p,…] [--exclude p,…] [--exclude-namespace pfx…] [--list-providers] [--format tsv]` | Stage-2 over facts: re-derive effects + page/action/background/wcf entry points + **classified** handoffs (background/timer/actor/event, by dispatcher + registration site, with an `async_handoff` note) + promoted handoff origins; unclassified-methodGroup residual collapsed to a count. One DB open, one rule load. **`--list-providers`** prints the valid `--only`/`--exclude` token set (an unknown token WARNS on stderr, no longer silent). **`--exclude-namespace <prefix>`** (repeatable) drops hazard findings whose enclosing namespace starts with the prefix (hazards only; effects unaffected). Hazard rollup is deduped per `(type, method)` with a `×N` site count; header reads "N site(s) across M method(s)". |
| `rig entrypoints [--rules p…] [--store ref] [--limit n] [--format tsv]` | The rule-detected entry-point set (page/action/class-inheritance + promoted async-handoff origins — the SAME set `derive`/`callers --entrypoints`/`impact` build), grouped by kind, with service attribution when `deployments.json` is present. A focused listing without `derive`'s effect + classified-handoff sections. Each EP also carries its queryable FQN — a `↪ <fqn>` line in human output (suppressed when it equals the route) and a trailing `fqn` column under `--format tsv` (one row per EP: kind, route, file, line, requires, loaded services, active services, **fqn**). |
| `rig reaches <pat> [--async] [--include-delivery] [--maxdepth n] [--only p,…] [--exclude p,…] [--format tsv]` | Effects reachable forward. **Synchronous by default** (async handoffs NOT crossed). **`--async`** walks handoffs → an extra **async (scheduled)** `⚡cross_thread` bucket (`⤳ via <dispatcher>`) alongside direct + dispatch-fan-out, but EXCLUDES imprecise delivery fan-out (multi-subscriber `event_raise`/`actor_tell`); **`--include-delivery`** adds that over-approximate superset back. Annotates loop-fanout (`🔁xN`) + per-effect emoji. TSV trailing `handoffVia` column. |
| `rig tree <pat> [--view paths\|full\|effects\|summary\|hazards] [--format llm\|llm-ids] [--guards] [--plain] [--files] [--sig] [--suppress ctors,lambdas\|none] [--async] [--include-delivery] [--only p,…] [--exclude p,…] [--exclude-namespace pfx…] [--maxdepth n] [--limit n]` | Call TREE (box-drawing, source-ordered, emoji per effect). **`--view`** (default `paths` = effectful paths, spine-kept): `full` = all nodes; `effects` = flat effectful-method list; `summary` = effect-count rollup; `hazards` = hazard overlay. **Synchronous by default**; **`--async`** crosses handoffs (`⤳handoff via <dispatcher> [cross_thread]`). `↺seen` marks cycle/shared-callee re-entry. **`--guards`** marks branch-gated edges with `⎇ [condition]` (control dependence; see the guards section below); composes with every view AND with `--format` (a trailing `guards` column). **`--format llm`** = compact LLM TSV (`depth name arity calls effects flags`; ASCII `effect*N`, arity-stripped names, parent implicit via depth+DFS order; truncation flags split by cause — `seen` = already-expanded-elsewhere (the redundancy signal), `depth-capped` = hit `--maxdepth`, `budget-capped` = hit the node budget (`--limit n`, default 50000)); **`--format llm-ids`** = 8-col with explicit `id`/`parent_id` + `seen:<canonicalId>` O(1) back-ref (back-ref only on `seen`; `depth-capped`/`budget-capped` carry no id). `--format llm*` composes with paths/full/effects (not summary/hazards); **`--suppress`** (default `ctors,lambdas` for llm) drops ctor/lambda rows, rolling their effects up. **Presentation:** **`--plain`** drops the box-drawing connectors (`├─ └─ │`) for pure indentation (diff-friendly, pipe-to-editor); **`--files`** appends each node's source location; **`--sig`/`--signatures`** adds compact parameter signatures (disambiguates overloads). |
| `rig callers <pat> [--roots\|--entrypoints] [--async] [--include-delivery] [--rules p…] [--maxdepth n]` | Reverse reachability. **Synchronous by default**, so a background callback has no synchronous predecessor → it surfaces as its own `--roots` origin; **`--async`** counts the registrar as reaching it via the handoff. `--roots` = no-predecessor candidates (heuristic — also surfaces unbound interface members). **`--entrypoints` = the RULE-DETECTED entry points (the `derive` set: page/action/handler + promoted handoff origins) that reach the target** — the precise "which of my real entry points touch this code", joined by declaration site. The matched TARGET (and its own lambdas) is listed under a separate "Matched nodes" section, NOT counted as a caller. `--roots` is a SUPERSET of `--entrypoints` (heuristic vs rule-detected). Under `--entrypoints` each EP carries its queryable FQN (a `↪ <fqn>` human line + trailing `fqn` tsv column) — paste that into `tree`/`reaches`, not the slash route. |
| `rig path <from> <to> [--async] [--include-delivery]` | One concrete path (BFS-shortest), with per-hop file:line + loop context. Synchronous by default; **`--async`** crosses + renders the `⤳ handoff via <dispatcher>` hop. |
| `rig impact --base <ref> --head <ref> [--structural] [--async] [--include-delivery] [--expect-no-effect-change] [--expect-no-guard-narrowing] [--only p,…] [--exclude p,…] [--no-cache] [--no-gate] [--limit n] [--format tsv]` | **Two-store diff**: the entry-point + per-EP effect/reach changes between two indexed commits (it diffs the two STORES — no git working-tree diff, no `--repo`). **BOTH `--base` and `--head` REQUIRED** (each resolves a ref→sha→store via `--store`-style refs; no LATEST defaulting). (1) changed methods (FILE-granular over-approx), (2) affected entry points by deployed service, (3) behavioral delta = effects/observations reachable from the changed set, head vs base (`+`/`-effect`, `+/-observation`; param-free keys → formatting/signature-immune). The **per-entry-point effect-set diff is the DEFAULT** (surfaces path-masked deltas + relocations); **`--structural`** expands the structural-only summary into the full reach-changed EP list; **`--expect-no-effect-change`** = CI gate (exit 1 on any effect-set change). (4) **`guard_condition_delta`** = call edges whose control-dependence CONDITION moved while the call and its effects stayed put — the predicate-only class the other three signals are structurally blind to (audit suppression, permission tightening, feature-flag gating). Verdict is `narrowed` (base conjuncts ⊂ head — fires on strictly FEWER paths), `widened`, or `changed` (incomparable); the row carries base→head conditions, the effects reachable FROM the callee, and how many EPs reach the caller. **`--expect-no-guard-narrowing`** gates on `narrowed` only. Keyed on the EDGE, since an effect's own guard set is usually empty (the gating condition is an ancestor edge's). Classification is syntactic conjunct containment — reformat/comment-immune, but an over-approximation. Needs BOTH commits indexed **by a rig ≥ 2026-07-27** (earlier stores lack guards on lambda edges and have inverted polarity on negated conditions). See SKILL.md. |
| `rig effects-diff <a> <b> [--only p…] [--label s] [--format tsv]` | Symmetric difference of the forward-reachable EFFECT-SETS of two entry points — what one touches that the other doesn't. `--only <provider[:op]>` (repeatable) scopes it (e.g. write-set divergence `--only llblgen:write --only llblgen:bulk_write --only llblgen:delete`); `--label` names the pair in output. EP-vs-EP within one store (vs `impact`, which is commit-vs-commit). |
| `rig dispatch-fans [--top n] [--cause absent-receiver\|base-typed-receiver\|external-or-unbound\|type-parameter] [--format tsv]` | Diagnostic: dispatch hubs whose receiver did NOT narrow the CHA fan-out, ranked + classified by cause — the residual over-approximation surface (a calibration aid for receiver narrowing, not an everyday query). |
| `rig graph` | Rebuild the derived call-graph views (`call_edges`+`dispatch_edges`) from facts — the fast SQL traversal path. Idempotent, no rescan. **Now run automatically at the tail of `index`** (opt out: `index --no-graph`); run standalone after editing `handoffDispatchers`/factory rules (no re-index needed). |
| `rig dead [--lib] [--include-dispatch] [--all] [--root pat…] [--rules p…] [--format tsv]` | Unreachable first-party methods. Report-only. ⚠️ **Currently DISABLED** (unwired in Root.cs — errors "not matched"). See SKILL.md. |
| `rig refs <pat> [--first-party] [--kind <refkind>] [--limit n]` | Reference facts to a symbol (invocation/methodGroup/ctor/typeUse/throw/attributeUse). |
| `rig symbols <pat> [--kind <k>] [--limit n] [--no-lambdas]` | Declared symbols (method/type/property/field/event). `--no-lambdas` drops compiler `~λ`/`<>c` noise; when truncated prints "showing N of TOTAL". |
| `rig show <pat> [--context n] [--limit n]` | Source text of a matched declaration (`Line`..`EndLine`), with a line-number gutter. **Attribution is enforced:** the working tree is read only when the store is clean, `SourceCommit` == HEAD, and that file is unmodified; otherwise the indexed revision is read from git and marked `(from git <sha>)`. If neither is possible it prints `file:line` plus a one-line reason rather than lines it cannot attribute. Declarations over 400 lines are truncated with an explicit marker. |
| `rig di` | DI registrations (code + XML service descriptors + static rule mappings), run-agnostic. |
| `rig files --skipped` | Source files skipped during indexing + why (diagnostic). |
| `rig profile validate` | Validate the rules config for the working solution. |

There is no longer a separate "legacy" command model: everything is computed from the fact tables
(`symbol_facts`/`reference_facts`/`type_relation_facts` + run-agnostic `di_registrations`/`source_files`),
DocID-joined, with no per-run stitching. The old `entrypoints`/`effects`/`trace`/`callgraph(s)` commands
were removed — use `derive` (effects + entry points), `reaches`/`tree`/`callers`/`path` (call graph).

### Which commands accept which "global" options (there is no true global set)

`--rules` is **not** a universal flag, and this is deliberate rather than an oversight: it is accepted only by
commands whose OUTPUT IS A FUNCTION OF THE RULES. Raw fact readers ignore rules entirely, so accepting a
no-op `--rules` there would be worse than rejecting it — it would imply the rules shaped a result they did
not touch.

| option | accepted by | rejected by |
|---|---|---|
| `--rules` | `index`, `derive`, `reaches`, `tree`, `callers`, `path`, `impact`, `entrypoints`, `dispatch-fans` | `symbols`, `refs`, `files`, `runs`, `show`, `di`, `profile` |
| `--store` | every read command | `runs` (enumerates ALL stores by design), `profile` |
| `--format` | `derive`, `reaches`, `tree`, `callers`, `path`, `impact`, `entrypoints`, `effects-diff`, `show` | `symbols`, `refs`, `files`, `runs`, `di`, `profile` |

So `rig symbols "Foo" --rules ./rig.rules.json` fails with `Unrecognized command or argument '--rules'`, and
that is correct — drop the flag. Rule of thumb: **if the command derives, it takes `--rules`; if it just
reads stored facts, it does not.**

Known gap (not a bug, but worth knowing): the fact readers `symbols`/`refs`/`files`/`di` have **no
`--format`**, so there is no TSV mode for them — parse their human output, or use `derive --format tsv` if
what you need is derivable.

### `--format llm` / `llm-ids` — exact column contract (read before parsing it programmatically)

The column SCHEMA depends on `--view`, which trips up a parser told a fixed width:

| `--view` | `--format llm` columns (TSV) | `--format llm-ids` columns (TSV) |
|---|---|---|
| `paths` (default), `full` | `depth name arity calls effects flags` (6) | `id parent_id depth name arity calls effects flags` (8) |
| `effects` | `depth parent name arity calls effects flags` (7 — adds `parent`) | `id parent_id depth name arity calls effects flags` (8) |

- **`parent_id` MEANS DIFFERENT THINGS per view (correctness trap):** in `paths`/`full` it is the
  CALL-GRAPH parent (your direct caller); in `effects` it is the NEAREST EFFECTFUL ANCESTOR, which may be
  several call hops above the real caller. Don't reason about "who called this" from `effects`-view
  `parent_id`.
- **`depth` in `--view effects` is the ORIGINAL call-tree depth** — non-contiguous down the flat list
  (e.g. 1,6,10,5,…). Reconstruct structure from `parent`/`parent_id`, NOT from `depth`. In `paths`/`full`,
  rows are DFS pre-order so a row's parent is the nearest preceding row at `depth-1` (and `parent_id` confirms it).
- **`flags` truncation token differs by format:** bare `seen` in `--format llm`; `seen:<canonicalId>` in
  `llm-ids` (the id of the first full expansion). `depth-capped`/`budget-capped` are the same in both and
  never carry an id. A regex over `flags` must accept both `seen` and `seen:<n>`.
- The root row's `calls` is a sentinel (`1`), not a caller count — meaningless for an entry point.
- Token budget: ~6–10× smaller than `--format tsv`. `--suppress ctors,lambdas` (the llm default) rolls
  suppressed nodes' effects onto the nearest kept ancestor (no effect lost); `--suppress none` to see them.
- **`--guards` appends ONE trailing `guards` column** to every format (`tsv`, `llm`, `llm-ids`, all views):
  the control-dependence condition gating that node's reaching edge (e.g. `result == Yes || result == No`),
  empty for a must-run edge. A DEDICATED last column, not a `flags` token, because a condition can contain
  `||` which would collide with the `|`-joined flags. Schema-stable when the flag is absent (no column added).

**Commit-scoped stores + `--store`.** `index` writes a per-commit store `.rig/<short-commit>/` (`-dirty`
when the work tree is dirty, `ts-<stamp>` off-git) + a `.rig/LATEST` pointer; reads default to LATEST. Every
read command (`reaches`/`tree`/`path`/`callers`/`derive`/`graph`) and `impact --base` accepts **`--store
<ref>`** (aliases `--commit`/`--at`) to target a specific store by store-id or commit-sha prefix — hold two
commits side by side and diff. A pre-layout flat `.rig/rig.db` is still read (moved to `.legacy.bak` on the
next index).

DocID shapes: `M:Ns.Type.Method(ArgTypes)`, `T:Ns.Type`, `!:Name` (error type — a reference that
failed to bind). Generic: open form `Foo\`1`, instantiated `Foo{T:Ns.X}`.

### Pattern matching — substring, but EXACT MATCH WINS

The `<pat>`/`<from>`/`<to>` argument resolves to call-graph nodes via the SAME matcher for every traversal
(`tree`/`reaches`/`callers`/`callers --roots`/`path` roots **and** the `path` target):

- **Default = case-insensitive SUBSTRING** over node DocIDs — use the DOTTED form (`Type.Method`), the
  convenient way to name a method without its namespace or signature.
- **EXACT MATCH WINS.** If the pattern exactly equals a node's **full DocID** (`M:Ns.Type.Method`) **or its
  `M:`-stripped, param-free FQN** (`Ns.Type.Method` — the form `rig` renders, see below), ONLY the
  exact-matching node(s) are seeded; the substring set is used **only as a fallback** when there is no exact
  hit. Generic arity is kept (`Ns.Type.WorkflowPaneBase\`1.Save`), so paste the FQN verbatim. Case-insensitive,
  same as the substring pass; multiple exact hits (overloads sharing a param-free FQN) all seed.
- **Why it matters — prefix twins.** Substring alone dragged in every member a name is a PREFIX of: the full
  FQN `MedDBase.Pages.Appointment.Search.Search.Proceed` substring-matched BOTH `…Search.Proceed` AND
  `…Search.ProceedToConfirmationScreen`, so `rig tree <fqn>` rendered a spurious SECOND root. Exact-match-wins
  resolves the full FQN to exactly `Proceed`; `ProceedToConfirmationScreen` only appears where it is genuinely
  reached (as a deeper callee), never as an extra root. A **partial/short** pattern (`Search.Proceed`, `Save`)
  never equals a full namespaced FQN, so it keeps the substring behaviour (matches both twins) — exact-wins is
  strictly a refinement, not a behaviour change for partials.
- **AMBIGUITY IS DISCLOSED (stderr).** When a pattern resolves to >1 **distinct** symbol (same method name on
  different types — overloads don't count, they share a param-free FQN), every traversal command prints
  `note: pattern 'X' matched N distinct symbols (…) — results span ALL of them; qualify the pattern to narrow.`
  The results are the UNION across all matched targets (a tree forest with mixed roots, a merged caller/reach
  set) — when you see the note and meant ONE symbol, re-run with the qualified `Type.Method`/FQN. On stderr so
  `--format tsv/llm` stdout stays machine-clean; an LLM driving rig should treat the note as a signal to
  re-query qualified before trusting the merged answer.
- **Use the FQN, not the EP route.** The `▶` / `callers --entrypoints` EP lines print the slash-form ROUTE
  (`Appointment/Search/Search.Proceed`), which matches NOTHING as a pattern. `derive`/`entrypoints`/`callers
  --entrypoints` now ALSO print the queryable FQN — a `↪ <fqn>` line in human output and a trailing `fqn`
  column under `--format tsv` (`impact` already labelled its EP cards with it). Copy THAT FQN; exact-match-wins
  then resolves it to precisely that member. (The FQN line/column is suppressed when it equals the route —
  e.g. class-inheritance EPs, whose route already IS the FQN — and falls back to the route for sites with no
  indexed method symbol, like ctor-less pages and promoted handoff origins.) Unexpected empty / "No path" /
  "0 call edges" → suspect a route-form pattern first.

## The rule / detector model — "detectors are data"

All entry-point and effect detection is JSON rules (cascaded: builtin `builtin-rules.json` +
`--rules`), consumed by data-driven derivers. **No detector logic is hardcoded in C#** — adding a rule
gives new answers with no re-extraction. Rule knobs that exist:
- **Effect rules**: `provider`/`operation`, `methods`, `declaringTypes` / `declaringTypeNameEndsWith` /
  `declaringTypeBaseTypes`, `receiverTypes`, containing-namespace/type/method gates, `matchConstructor`
  + `minArguments` (ctor-fetch, e.g. `new XxxEntity(pk)`), `matchThrow` (thrown exception type), resource-resolution strategy.
- **Entry-point rules**: `pageModel` (base-type BFS closure → ctors), `[Attribute]` action rules,
  `classInheritance` (base + interface closure, `requireOverride`, `handlerMethodAttributes`,
  `handlerParameterTypes`).
- **File rules**: `files.exclude` globs (default excludes `**/*.g.cs`, `**/*.generated.cs`,
  `**/*.designer.cs`, `**/Generated/**`, **and `**/tests/**`**), `testProjectPatterns`.

Detector families seen in practice (MedDBase rules): `llblgen` (entity read/write/delete, ctor-fetch),
`entity_cache` (`*Cache.New(pk)` source-of-truth reads), `object_store` (IObjectStore Create/Update/Delete),
`throw` (incl. LanguageExt `failwith`/`raise` via `declaring_type` strategy), `clientpage_nav/event/proxy`,
`chamber_msg` / `eventbus` (messaging), `soap`/`http`/`queue`/`llm` (external providers).

**Filtering effects** (`reaches`/`tree`/`derive`): `--only <list>` keeps just those, `--exclude <list>`
drops them (exclude wins on overlap). The list is **comma- OR whitespace-separated and repeatable**; tokens
match `provider` (`throw`) or `provider:operation` (`llblgen:read`). Headline: **`--exclude throw`** to drop
exception noise. Per-effect emoji glyphs are overridable per-repo via `rig.effect-emoji.json` (or
`.rig/effect-emoji.json`): a flat `{"llblgen:write":"💾","soap":"☎️",…}`, looked up `provider:operation` →
`provider` → `•`.

## Reachability / dispatch behaviour

The graph follows: direct calls + method-group + ctor edges, **interface→impl** dispatch (single-impl
DI hop), and **base-virtual/abstract→override** dispatch (transitive, generic-stripped, IsOverride-gated).

**Exact dispatch facts (mined-first model).** The member-level interface→impl / base→override
correspondence is MINED by Roslyn at extraction into `dispatch_facts`
(`IMethodSymbol.OverriddenMethod` for overrides, `FindImplementationForInterfaceMember` for interface
impls — signature-exact and generic-correct, incl. explicit interface impls and same-arity overloads
that name matching cross-contaminates). Query-time dispatch uses these FIRST (`Basis="roslyn"`,
forward closure over the immediate mined hops); the old name+arity CHA scan remains ONLY as a
fallback for members with no mined edge, plus the always-on `!:` error-edge simple-name recovery —
both flagged **`Basis="heuristic"`** and rendered with a `~heuristic` marker (tree
`«impl-dispatch ~heuristic»`, path `[impl-dispatch (heuristic)]`, reaches `~heuristic` suffix, TSV
`dispatchBasis` column) — meaning: the dispatch target was inferred by name/arity because Roslyn
couldn't bind that interface/base (net48 partial binding); high-but-not-perfect, verify before relying
on it. `rig graph` prints the roslyn-vs-heuristic split; `dispatch_edges` carries
`Basis`. Heuristic share on a healthy single-workspace index is small (the `!:` residue); a store
indexed BEFORE dispatch facts existed derives all-heuristic until re-indexed (extraction change →
re-`rig index` + `rig graph` to benefit).

**Async handoff edges (`Kind="handoff"`).** A method-group consumed by a curated `handoffDispatchers`
dispatcher (background/timer/actor/event scheduler) is reclassified to a `handoff` edge at graph-build
time (`HandoffClassifier`, co-location on the registration site; written to `call_edges.Kind` +
`HandoffDispatcher` by `rig graph`). Traversal **cuts these by default** (sync — a registration doesn't
look like it runs its callback) and walks them under **`--async`**, carrying a `HandoffVia` provenance tag
(cloned from the `DispatchVia` machinery: inherited through the scheduled subtree, dropped where a node is
also reachable synchronously). `--async` is uniform across `reaches`/`tree`/`path`/`callers`/`impact`.

**Three traversal modes (`FactPathFinder.TraversalMode`, gate = `FactPathFinder.CutsHandoff`).** `SyncCut`
(default) cuts every handoff. **`AsyncExact` (the `--async` default)** crosses sound handoffs but CUTS
publish→consumer DELIVERY FAN-OUT — edges where `AddDeliveryEdges` joined a raise to MANY same-symbol
subscribers (`CallEdge.DeliveryPrecision == "fanout"`), a symbol/name join with no instance identity that
links unrelated callers to unrelated handlers (see docs/FIX-event-raise-overapproximation.md). **`AsyncInclude`
(`--async --include-delivery`)** crosses everything incl. the fan-out. Single-subscriber delivery is stamped
`"exact"` and IS walked under AsyncExact (unambiguous). The `event_cycle` deriver reads `CallEdges` directly,
so it always sees every delivery edge regardless of mode. Invariants the SQL path holds: `CHA-oracle(sync) ==
SQL(Kind<>'handoff')`; the bounded SQL load is the **async-INCLUDE superset** (it pulls all handoffs incl.
fan-out), and the in-memory `FactPathFinder` is the arbiter that prunes fan-out for AsyncExact — so
`AsyncExact ⊆ AsyncInclude ⊆ bounded-load`, `sync ⊆ AsyncExact`. **`dead`
keeps ALL method-group AND handoff targets as roots** regardless of classification (recall rail), so a
scheduled-only callback is never falsely flagged dead.

**Receiver-type narrowing (precision — the signal/noise fix).** `tree`/`reaches`/`path`/`callers` resolve
dispatch **edge-aware**: a virtual/base/interface call narrows to the *static receiver type* mined onto the
call edge (`CallEdge.ReceiverType`), so `company.Save()` reaches `CompanyEntity.Save` (+ Company subtypes),
NOT all ~114 `CommonEntityBase.Save` overrides. It falls back to **full CHA** whenever the receiver is
unreliable (null / an interface / an error-type `!:` / the declaring base itself / not a first-party CHA
target) — so no real target is dropped. Effect of this on the MedDBase monolith: `ProcessHealthcodeQueue
--effects` went 604→405 and the 114-way Save god-seam vanished. Two notes:
- The precomputed `dispatch_edges` table (which BOUNDS the SQL load) stays **CHA (the sound superset)**;
  narrowing lives only in the in-memory traversal. So SQL set-reachability ⊇ the narrowed in-memory set.
- Reverse (`callers`) narrowing is **dispatch-hop-precise, not path-precise**: once a shared base method
  (e.g. `CommonEntityBase.Save`) enters the reverse closure, all its direct callers rejoin (set-based BFS
  can't attribute which caller's receiver matched). Recall-preserving; some reverse precision is left on
  the table. Residual forward fan-outs (×2–×13) are genuinely base/interface-typed receivers
  (controllers/`IWorkflowMaster`, actor dispatch, loggers) correctly falling back to CHA — "all bets off
  past these god-seams".

**Reading effect counts:** an effect listed N times = **N static call-sites** that reach it (branches
included), NOT N runtime writes — an insert-vs-update method shows the same write twice; one fires per call.
`reaches` also splits genuine reach from a **dispatch fan-out** bucket (`reach is … NOT a real call`); read
the direct-effects / depth-shallow surface as the real contract.

Recall recoveries already built in:
- **`!:` error-edge fallback** — under partial binding an implementer's interface edge can be an error
  type (`!:IFoo`) while the call resolved the real type; dispatch recovers via interface simple-name,
  marked `~heuristic`. (Highest-impact recall fix — never removed by the exact-dispatch model.)
- **generic-stripped lookup** — a base edge stores instantiated `Foo{A,B}` while methods are on open
  `Foo\`2`; lookups strip generics so dispatch still lands.
- **transitive in-set project references** — the index workspace wires the full transitive closure of
  in-set project refs as live Roslyn ProjectReferences (not just direct), so a project using a
  transitively-referenced project's types binds them as ONE identity. Without this, calls whose
  signature mentions such a type silently drop (was the cause of massive `rig dead` false positives).

## Control-dependence guards (`--guards`)

`tree --guards` partitions an EP's reachable calls into the **must-run spine** vs the **guarded shell**, from
a CFG control-dependence analysis frozen at INDEX onto each call site (`ReferenceFact.EnclosingGuards`).

- **Render**: a branch-gated edge shows `⎇ [condition]` beside the node (the analog of `🔁[loop]`); a must-run
  (unconditional-in-its-caller) edge shows nothing — so the glyph-free frames are what runs on EVERY
  invocation. In `--format tsv|llm|llm-ids` the condition is a trailing `guards` column (empty = must-run).
- **The condition is the FULL source predicate**, reconstructed from the lowered CFG: a short-circuit
  `a || b` renders whole (not split into `a`/`b`), an else-arm is negated `!(…)` (De Morgan handled), and the
  `foreach (x in C)` MoveNext guard is dropped as redundant with `🔁[x in C]`. Multiple DISTINCT decisions
  (a loop condition + an inner `if`) `&&`-join.
- **INTRA-METHOD only (don't over-read it).** A guard says the call is gated WITHIN its direct caller — NOT
  whether that caller itself always runs from the entry point. The cross-method "always-runs-from-EP"
  composition (AND-folding guards along the EP→…→call chain) is a DERIVE-side follow-up, not yet built.
- **Lambda and method-group edges carry guards too, but only since 2026-07-27.** `Call(() => …)` and
  `Call(Helper.Do)` are call-graph edges; before that fix they carried NO guard (0 of 65,450 lambda edges on
  the MedDBase store), so every effect inside a lambda created in an `if` read as **must-run**. On an older
  store the spine is over-inclusive — it silently includes conditional work. **Re-index before trusting the
  spine/shell partition.**
- **The guard is on the EDGE, not on the effect.** An effect inside a lambda body is unconditional *within
  that body*; the condition gating whether the lambda runs at all sits on the edge into it, which may be
  several frames up. So "this effect's guard set is empty" does NOT mean "this effect always fires" — compose
  along the path.
- Built always-on at index (scoped to bodies with references); ~no measurable extraction cost (MedDBase
  extract held ~29s with it on). A store indexed by a pre-guards `rig` shows no guards until re-indexed.

## Fundamental static-analysis limits (NOT bugs — interpret results with these in mind)

- **Actor / message-passing boundaries** (e.g. Echo.Process `.tell`/`.ask`/Router) are NOT call edges —
  effects inside actor inboxes are invisible; the boundary is uncrossable statically.
- **Reflection dispatch** (`GetMethod(name).Invoke`, `[ClientAction]` request handlers) has no caller
  edge. rig models such handlers as INDEPENDENT entry points where a rule exists, but won't link caller→callee.
- **`Activator.CreateInstance` / DI-by-name / serialization** — instantiation/use not visible as a call.
- **Cross-process calls** (HTTP to another service, payment gateways) end the trace.
- **Property/event use isn't an invocation fact** — lazy nav-property loads, operator use, accessor
  calls don't appear as edges (why `rig dead` excludes accessors/operators).
- Runtime cardinalities (×N loop fanout beyond the static nesting count, "called 8 times") are estimates, not facts.

## Env gotchas

- **`dtb-cache` is keyed by ABSOLUTE PATH — index base and head from the SAME checkout path.** The
  design-time-build cache (`.rig/dtb-cache`, on by default) does most of the work of an index, and a different
  checkout path gets **0% reuse**. Measured on MedDBase: a fresh `git worktree` at `C:\Git\mdb-wt-4702` took
  **10m33s**, versus **3m58s** for the same commit range re-indexed from the original clone path — a ~2.7×
  penalty. This is a trap because "use a worktree so you don't disturb your checkout" is otherwise good
  advice: for indexing it is the expensive choice. Index in the primary checkout (switch commits there) unless
  the working tree genuinely must stay put, and expect the full cost when it must.
  Also check `rig runs` first — stores are commit-scoped, so an already-indexed commit needs no build at all.
- **`rig index` builds internally — no external pre-build.** One bare `rig index <sln>` call runs a
  parallel, cached design-time build itself then extracts (defaults are sane; `--parallelism`/
  `--reuse-build-cache` are tuning knobs, not required); the old "MSBuild first" step is obsolete. `index`
  is the sole extraction command. **Prefer the full solution**: `index --from <csproj>` (the entry-scoped
  closure, the old `mine`) follows ProjectReference edges only — solution projects consumed as binary/paket
  references fall outside the closure and their internals are absent from the store, while query-side rules
  still tag their APIs at call sites, so the store looks complete without being traversable into them.
  Never run two `index` commands against one clone at once.
- **`rig index` REPLACES atomically** (temp + rename) — re-running a standalone `index` cleanly overwrites;
  no need to delete `.rig` first. Only `index --identity` (multi-solution accumulate) APPENDS in place.
- **Multi-solution unified store — `rig index <sln> --merge`.** A repo with many solutions (MedDBase has
  ~20) is indexed into ONE queryable store by running `index` once per solution with `--merge` (accumulate
  into the existing store) instead of replacing. The store is **commit-scoped**: every solution from the same
  working tree maps to the same `<shortsha>-dirty` store dir, so all merges land together; `rig runs` then
  lists **one run per solution** under that store, and `tree`/`reaches`/`callers`/`derive` span all of them.
  Mechanics + gotchas:
  - **`--merge` ≈ `--identity` auto-derived from the commit** — you usually don't pass `--identity` by hand;
    `--merge` appends a new run keyed to the current commit. (`--identity` is the lower-level "append under
    this explicit id" knob, used by the legacy `mine`.) Re-merging the same solution updates its run.
  - **Pass `--rules <ruleset>.json` on EVERY merge** (same INDEX-time rules asymmetry as above) — else that
    solution's DI/XML-DI come back empty.
  - **Cross-solution assembly divergence is tolerated, not fatal**: when two solutions compile the same
    assembly (e.g. `MMS.Standard`) with different content, index WARNs `possible fork; keeping latest` and
    continues — it does not abort the merge. Worth a glance in the log; "keeping latest" can mask a real fork.
  - **Bulk-merge resiliently**: loop the solutions with continue-on-failure + per-solution logging. One
    `index` at a time per clone (never two concurrent against one working tree).
  - **The common failure is `DegradedBuildException` ("design-time build produced 0 source files after 3
    attempts")** — rig REFUSES to index a project whose DTB yields no source (it would write absent types +
    mis-bound dependents = a corrupt index) rather than silently degrade, and **aborts the WHOLE solution**
    if any one project degrades. Causes, in order of likelihood:
    1. **Un-restored solution.** For MedDBase the restore tool is **Paket**, not NuGet — `.paket/paket.exe
       restore` at the repo root (a `msbuild -t:Restore` / `dotnet restore` returns rc=1 here). Then MSBuild.
    2. **Legacy net48 ASP.NET web projects** (`<TargetFrameworkVersion>v4.8` + `UseIISExpress` +
       `Microsoft.WebApplication.targets`, e.g. `MedDBase.Site`, `ContractManagement.Site`) yield **0 source
       via Buildalyzer DTB even after a clean Paket-restore + successful MSBuild + `--no-build-cache`** — the
       web build targets don't surface `Compile` items to Buildalyzer. These index ONLY through an
       MSBuild-built + entry-`--from <csproj>` pipeline, or must be **excluded** from the merge. Their
       `.aspx`/web layer is entry points, not data-access, so they rarely matter for effect/hazard detectors.
    3. **`.sqlproj` DB-model solutions** (`ChambersDbModel`, `Permissions-db-model`) — not C#, never indexable.
    (On MedDBase's ~20 solutions: ~half merge clean after Paket-restore; the net48-web + sqlproj ones don't.)
  - **`--from <csproj>` whose closure resolves to 0 buildable C# projects CRASHES** with an unhandled
    `IndexOutOfRangeException` (`SolutionSourceLoader.LoadAsync`) instead of a clean "nothing to index" —
    known rig defect; don't read the crash as a store problem.
  - **Why bother**: a single-solution store silently makes every entry point in the OTHER solutions invisible
    and can turn real cross-solution callers into apparent dead code / phantom-only reach. Index all the
    application solutions before trusting reachability/dead-code/`callers --entrypoints` across the product.
- **Rules load at INDEX time vs QUERY time are asymmetric** — `rig index` resolves rules relative to the SOLUTION dir (+ builtin/global), NOT the analysis cwd. **DI registrations + the XML DI miner (`xmlDiFiles`) are captured at INDEX time**, so if your ruleset lives in the analysis cwd you MUST pass `--rules <that>.json` to `rig index` or `rig di` comes back empty (effects/entry points are derived at QUERY time from cwd rules, so they look fine — the asymmetry is silent). Symptom: `DiRegistrations: 0` despite XML service descriptors existing.
- **Index with the published/global `rig`**; the plain Debug bin throws `System.Composition.TypedParts`
  not found from `AdhocWorkspace` (missing MEF deps). Read-only queries work from any build.
- **Generated/source-gen types**: only indexed if generators actually run during the build (Buildalyzer
  design-time builds may not run them) — a known gap for generator-produced types (e.g. proxy base types).
- **Base-type-chain binding flake**: a run can show entrypoints/effects ≈0 with healthy symbols/refs when
  a cross-assembly base type (in metadata) didn't bind that run — net48 reference-resolution flakiness, not a logic bug. Re-index / broaden scope.

## Building & shipping the tool (coderig repo)

- Fast iterate (read-only queries): `dotnet build src/Rig.Cli/Rig.Cli.csproj -c Debug -p:UseSharedCompilation=false`
  then `dotnet <…>/bin/Debug/net10.0/Rig.Cli.dll <args>` from the dir holding `.rig`.
- Ship to global (needed for `index`): `dotnet pack src/Rig.Cli/Rig.Cli.csproj -c Release -o .rig-nupkg /p:PackageVersion=$v /p:Version=$v` → `dotnet tool uninstall --global rig; dotnet tool install --global rig --add-source .rig-nupkg --version $v`. (The repo's `mini-ci.ps1` does this but the `-ExecutionPolicy Bypass` invocation may be blocked by the harness; run the pack/install steps directly.)
- Tests: `dotnet test tests/Rig.Tests/Rig.Tests.csproj -c Debug -p:UseSharedCompilation=false`. Fact-layer derivers are fixture-tested (no SQLite) in `FactDerivationTests`; pure-domain graph logic in `Domain/*Tests.cs`.
