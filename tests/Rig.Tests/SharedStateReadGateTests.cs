// FR-1 read-arm WRITE-PAIRING GATE (EffectDerivation.DeriveEffects, gate param — on by default). A
// shared_state:read effect on a static field is pure inventory unless its cell ALSO appears as a static-field
// WRITE somewhere (only then can it pair with the write for the race_window TOCTOU hazard). The gate (default
// ON) drops reads of never-written cells (const/enum/other immutable statics); --no-gate (gate: false) emits
// every read, preserving the legacy behaviour.
//
// Mirrors the FactFieldAccess + MatchFieldWrite construction in
// FactDerivationTests.Write_to_a_static_field_derives_a_shared_state_mutate_effect, adding the symmetric
// MatchFieldRead arm. Pure — no store needed; the gate lives in the pure derivation layer.
