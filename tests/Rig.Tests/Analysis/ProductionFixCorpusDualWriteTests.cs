// Corpus tests for the FR-8 hazard: `dual_write` — a distributed-consistency hazard where ONE enclosing
// method performs durable writes to ≥2 DIFFERENT system classes (DB + queue, DB + search, DB + cache, DB +
// external HTTP, …) in a single unit of work. If the second write fails after the first commits, the systems
// diverge with no atomicity; the classic mitigation is an outbox/inbox/CDC. The matcher (FactHazardDeriver
// .DeriveDualWrites) maps each method's durable WRITE effects to a system class via the system-class map from
// the `dualWrite.systemClassMap` RULES section (the corpus loads the shipped builtin one, as production does)
// and, when ≥2 distinct classes co-occur, attaches ONE dual_write observation (medium, naming the systems) to
// a representative write effect — annotate-only, suppressing nothing.
//
// Reliable surfaces here: System.Net.Http.HttpClient.PostAsync (http:POST, real framework ref) and a stubbed
// type whose name ends with "ObjectStore" with a Save method (object_store:write, per the builtin rule). The
// two are DISTINCT system classes ⇒ a dual_write; two http writes are NOT.
