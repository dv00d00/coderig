// the reachable frontier on disk via the edge index (~tens of ms, RAM ∝ result) — no daemon, no state.
//
// dispatch_edges is built from FactPathFinder.AllDispatchEdges, the SAME interface->impl /
// base->override resolution the in-memory oracle uses, so the SQL traversal sees exactly the edges the
