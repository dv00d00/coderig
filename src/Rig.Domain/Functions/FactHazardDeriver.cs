// Stage-2 HAZARD derivation: a post-pass over the already-derived effects that matches PATTERNS across
// effects (vs. an Effect, which is a single point fact). The first hazard is `race_window` — a
// read-modify-write / TOCTOU candidate: a READ of a shared cell followed by a WRITE of the SAME cell in
// the same method, the lost-update / check-then-act shape (RCA #2930: two users read appointment status,
// both write, one clobbers the other).
//
// This is a CODED matcher, not a pattern DSL. What is DATA is only which provider:operation is the "read"
// leg and which is the "write" leg (defaulted to shared_state:read / shared_state:mutate — the legs the
// FR-1 static-field arms emit). The pairing logic — same enclosing method, same cell, read-before-write
// line order, transaction-bracket tiering — is code.
//
// Annotate-only: it ADDS a race_window observation to the qualifying WRITE (mutate) effect and returns the
// effect list otherwise untouched. It removes/suppresses no effect and no observation. The race_window is
// modeled as an EffectObservationInfo (a note on an effect), reusing the existing observation model so it
// surfaces wherever observations already do.
//
// v1 is INTRA-METHOD: read and write must share an enclosing method, so the line order is an exact,
// cheap proof of "read happens-before write" on a straight-line path. Cross-method (path-level) pairing —
// a read in one method and a write in a callee/caller reached from it — is a follow-up that needs the call
// graph + a happens-before relation over it; deliberately not built here.

    //       fallbacks, if/else picks — yet is still initialised at most once at runtime. (Calibration:
    //       `PerformanceLogger.Factory` writes `instance` on 4 branches; the old single-write veto left all 4
    //       as high race_window noise — the dominant high-tier FP. The getter/ctor CONTEXT is a stronger

    //       `initialized`). A name heuristic is brittle, so this arm STILL requires the single-write do-once
    //       SHAPE: a multi-write cell named "instance" outside an init context is being driven, not initialised.

    // Everything else stays race_window: `if (Cache.Status == 0) Cache.Status = 1;` in a plain method is a real
    // mutate-existing check-then-act (no init context, non-init cell name). We do NOT gate on READ count: the
    // classic getter (`if (_x == null) … return _x;`) reads the cell more than once.
    //
