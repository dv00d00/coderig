// Stage-2-over-facts path finding: BFS the fact-derived call graph from any symbol matching

// Includes the interface->concrete DI hop (the single-impl dispatch from Q5) reconstructed from
// type-relation facts + DocID member-name matching — no Roslyn, no SemanticModel.
// (Rig.Domain targets netstandard2.0, so this avoids TryAdd / ranges / Contains(string,cmp).)
//
// Dispatch is resolved EXACT-FIRST: the member-level interface→impl / base→override correspondence
// comes from the Roslyn-MINED dispatch facts when present (FactGraphData.MinedDispatch, Basis=
// "roslyn" — signature-exact, generic-correct), with the name/arity CHA scan kept only as a FLAGGED
// fallback (Basis="heuristic") for members Roslyn couldn't bind (`!:` error-typed interfaces, unmined
// stores). And EDGE-AWARE (receiver-type narrowing): the in-memory traversal narrows a
// virtual/base/interface call to the STATIC RECEIVER TYPE mined onto the call edge (CallEdge.
// ReceiverType) — `company.Save()` reaches CompanyEntity.Save (+ Company subtypes), not all 114
// CommonEntityBase.Save overrides. It falls back to the full receiver-blind set whenever the receiver
// is unreliable (null/interface/error-type/the declaring base/not a known first-party type), so no
// real target is ever dropped. The precomputed dispatch_edges table and AllDispatchEdges stay
// receiver-blind (the sound superset that bounds the SQL load); narrowing lives ONLY in the
// in-memory edge traversal.
